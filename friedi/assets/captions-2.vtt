Hello everyone and welcome back to your&nbsp;
instructional design mini course. I'm super&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.600
excited to share this video with you and to show&nbsp;
you some cool features that you can use on Zoom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.040
during different kinds of trainings. So we'll&nbsp;
start with the first one which is going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:22.360
share screen. You can see the green button here&nbsp;
down at the bottom and you can click on it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.480
select which window you want to share. So for me,&nbsp;
I'm going to select this one and double click so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.280
it'll start sharing the screen. So this is the&nbsp;
PDF that we used last time for example. Alright,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.120
I'll stop the sharing and show you some other&nbsp;
features that might be useful. So another one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.480
could be to use breakout rooms down here which&nbsp;
divides the participants up into different rooms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.880
where they can interact with with each other and&nbsp;
increase their talking time maybe answering some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.000
questions or discussing topics that you&nbsp;
asked to discuss. So here you can decide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.920
if you want to assign automatically or manually&nbsp;
and decide how big the groups are as well. So I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.480
will close this and show you the chat function&nbsp;
which can also be used as another interactive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.040
feature where maybe you can ask questions,&nbsp;
people can type comments, ask questions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:24.080
whatever you want. "Hey everyone" for example. I&nbsp;
will close up this again and show you some more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.680
options. So another one would be reactions down&nbsp;
here where when someone else is talking and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.280
don't really want to interrupt them but you&nbsp;
still want to react to it, to show them that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.960
you agree for example, you could give them a&nbsp;
thumbs up or if you have a question. Someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.000
else is maybe saying something and you want to ask&nbsp;
something but don't want to interrupt them either,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.120
you could raise your hand and they'll know that&nbsp;
there's something you want to say. Lower the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:56.080
hand once you're done and it automatically does&nbsp;
that after a while too. So the last one I want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.240
show you is the whiteboards down here. There are&nbsp;
two options. You could create a new whiteboard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.680
which just lets you write down notes, ideas, and&nbsp;
thoughts during your meeting. It'll be saved for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.960
later so everyone can access it once you're done&nbsp;
as well. You can write a little message and draw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:21.840
something around it too if you wanted to. So you&nbsp;
can stop the sharing up here or you could also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.840
use a pre-recorded one an existing whiteboard.&nbsp;
So I've created one that's called three wishes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.760
for example and you can collaborate on it meaning&nbsp;
that everyone in the meeting can edit it and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.920
the one I've chosen here for example is called&nbsp;
three wishes which means that every participant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.040
for example could write three wishes for what&nbsp;
they're hoping to learn during the course or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.480
what they're excited about or whatever you&nbsp;
can think of. This would be me for example&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.240
and here I could choose three different options&nbsp;
and this is how you close it. Thank you so much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:06.360
for your attention and I hope you found some&nbsp;
cool new features that you're interested in
